# Chairman Bot

## Introduction

The chairman bot allows only a whitelist of users to post messages in a specific channel. Since Mattermost does not have the concept of a one-way notification channel (like Telegram's channels), Chairman could be added to the channel and cofigured so that only the "channel administrators" of said channel could post, reducing the likelyhood of cluttering the channele with Q&A's and irrelevant chatter.
